Below is a LeetCode-style problem prompt for implementing a serializer/deserializer protocol for a market data feed with a focus on low-latency and efficient memory use.

LeetCode-Style Problem: Market Data Feed Serializer/Deserializer

Problem Description

You are tasked with designing a serializer/deserializer protocol for a high-frequency market data feed at TXSE. Each market data record contains information about a trading event and must be converted to and from a compact binary format for efficient transmission and storage.

Your solution should implement the following two functions:
	1.	serialize(record): Given a market data record, convert it into a compact binary format (e.g., a vector of bytes).
	2.	deserialize(data): Given the binary representation, reconstruct the original market data record.

For this problem, a market data record is defined by the following structure:

struct MarketDataRecord {
    // Fixed-length symbol (e.g., up to 8 ASCII characters; pad with spaces if needed)
    char symbol[8]; 
    // Price as a double (8 bytes)
    double price;
    // Volume as a 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)
    uint32_t volume;
    // Timestamp as a 64-bit unsigned integer representing microseconds since epoch (8 bytes)
    uint64_t timestamp;
};

Requirements
	•	Low Latency: Your implementation should minimize dynamic memory allocations and avoid unnecessary copying. Use fixed-size buffers and binary (not text-based) serialization.
	•	Memory Efficiency: The binary format must be as compact as possible. Pack fields in the natural order and use little-endian encoding.
	•	Deterministic Format: The serialized format must be reversible; that is, deserialize(serialize(record)) should return the original record.

You are allowed to assume that all market data records are valid and that the symbol is always provided as a string of at most 8 ASCII characters (if the symbol is shorter than 8 characters, pad it with spaces on the right).

Function Signatures

Implement the following functions in C++:

#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

// Market data record structure.
struct MarketDataRecord {
    char symbol[8];
    double price;
    uint32_t volume;
    uint64_t timestamp;
};

// Serializes a MarketDataRecord into a compact binary representation.
std::vector<uint8_t> serialize(const MarketDataRecord& record);

// Deserializes a compact binary representation into a MarketDataRecord.
MarketDataRecord deserialize(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data);

Example

Suppose you are given the following market data record:

MarketDataRecord record;
std::memset(record.symbol, ' ', sizeof(record.symbol));  // Fill with spaces for padding
std::memcpy(record.symbol, "AAPL", 4);  // Symbol is "AAPL"
record.price = 150.25;
record.volume = 1000;
record.timestamp = 1610000000123456ULL;

Calling:

std::vector<uint8_t> data = serialize(record);
MarketDataRecord restored = deserialize(data);

Should yield a restored record that is identical to the original record (i.e., symbol “AAPL” padded to 8 characters, price 150.25, volume 1000, timestamp 1610000000123456).

Constraints
	1.	Low Latency and High Throughput: Your serialization and deserialization functions must run in constant time O(1) for each record and minimize any dynamic memory allocation.
	2.	Memory Usage: Use contiguous memory buffers (e.g., std::vector<uint8_t>) to store serialized data.
	3.	Endianness: Assume little-endian byte order for encoding numeric values.
	4.	Fixed Format: The binary format must be exactly 8 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 28 bytes per record.

Follow-Up
	1.	How might you extend this protocol to support variable-length fields (e.g., an optional commentary string) while still keeping the format efficient?
	2.	What techniques could you use to further optimize for low latency, especially in a multi-threaded market data processing system?
	3.	How could you incorporate checksums or message validation without significantly impacting performance?

This problem requires you to design a solution that not only correctly serializes and deserializes a market data record but also meets strict performance and memory constraints, as is typical in a high-frequency trading environment.

Good luck!
